# Exercise selection algorithm

## Requirements
V1
- The user cannot choose the exercises, they are selected for him
- The main objective is to optimize learning for the user
- Exercises are performed by the user from the easiest to the hardest
- Lessons have a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)
- Lessons or words that are more difficult for the user should be selected again more often
- A word or lesson is considered known if the score is higher than a predefined threshold
- The more lessons have been completed, the higher the threshold is; before moving on to the next lesson, 80% of the lessons must meet this threshold

V2
- Lessons score decrease over time, allowing the algorithm to select words or lessons more accurately
- The score update is performed on writes to save computer ressources, the accurateScore field is generated by mongoose by computing the updatedAt, decreaseFactor and score fields at read time

V3
- Users can start learning from one level (skip the easy part for example)
