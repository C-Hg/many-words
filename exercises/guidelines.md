# How to add new words to a lesson

1. create a new folder for a lesson if needed
1. copy the word template once for each word in the lesson
1. refer to already filled templates to understand the form

## Detailled instructions for the word template

- always write plain words, without quotes ("")
- words can have several parts like "to walk" or "apr√®s-midi"
- words are registered case-sensitively so capitalization should concern only words that always need to be capitalized e.g "Brazil"
- do not modify the template, the Markdown parser relies on it to properly seed the database

### General data

- true means that every words including alternatives have only one form, verbs for example or invariable words
- adjectives should have _unique form : false_, because the french adjectives have 4 forms
